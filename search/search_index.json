Introducion 1.1 Sleep Behaviours in Drosophila Melanogaster Sleep is an important yet complex physiological process that occurs in virtually every animal that has been studied so far, but its underpinnings and functions remain elusive despite the rapidly developing effort towards sleep analysis. Mammalian sleep is known to be a multistage process with varying sleep depth associated with changes in neuronal activity 1 2 3 . In humans, for example, electroencephalographic ( EEG ) recordings can be used to identify the different sleep stages which circulate between wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement ( REM ). It is believed that different sleep stages may serve distinct biological functions. For instance, evidence has shown that deep sleep contributes to bodily recovery and growth 4 , while REM sleep is essential to cognitive functions such as memory and learning 5 . Definitions EEG PE Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is a method that measures electrical activity in the brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp (Wikipedia) . A proboscis in insects refers to the tubular mouthpart used for feeding and sucking. Proboscis extension ( PE ) can either occur spontaneously or in response to antennal stimulation (Wikipedia) . Over the last few decades, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been an increasingly popular model organism to understand how sleep is regulated by internal and external stimuli and how it affects other biological functions. The simplicity, cost-effectiveness, rapid developmental time, and relevance to human genetics and physiology have made Drosophila an indispensable tool 6 . In most current studies, the sleeping state in Drosophila is defined by a simple metric: immobility for more than five minutes 7 , and it is often assumed to be homogenous throughout. Nevertheless, there has been increasing evidence that sleep in Drosophila is also a dynamic process with differing sleep intensities 8 . Methods including EEG recordings, arousal-testing, and Proboscis Extension ( PE ) measurements have been used together to show that Drosophila exhibits a deep sleep stage which is characterised by 1) reduced neural activity, 2) increased immobility, 3) increased arousal threshold, and 4) stereotypical PE movement, namely the periodic extensions and retractions of the proboscis 9 10 . These studies also indicated that Drosophila sleep follows a circadian rhythm, where flies sleep the most during start of the night, and it is also under homeostatic control as sleep deprivation leads to increased sleep amount and reduced sleep latency 10 . In this study, we turn to a novel method of measuring Drosophila behaviours using the Ethoscope, developed in the Gilestro lab , which can track the movement of a single fly housed in a glass tube 11 . This provides a simple, non-invasive, and high-throughput measurement of the external behaviour of sleep. The aim is to try and identify patterns in Drosophila locomotive data that can infer distinct sleep stages as indicated in previous research. 1.2 The Ethoscope An ethoscope contains a hardware that video-records the fly in a longitudinal glass tube and a software to track its activity in real-time by applying an oval mask over the fly with machine vision algorithms (Figure 1A & 1B) . The software can therefore track the x , y coordinates, width w and height h of the oval mask, and the angle phi between the line of W and the horizontal axis of the tube arena (Figure 1C) . This results in five different series of values recorded over time, which are called time series, for each fly (Figure 1D) . The ethoscope software also includes algorithms to calculate the maximum velocity and mean velocity at each time point, as well as behavioural annotators to indicate whether the fly is moving, exhibiting micro-movement, or immobile at a given time point.

B) A graphic representation of the oval mask and the variables X, Y, W, H and Phi of a single fly. C) Example output of the Ethoscope. 1.3 Time Series Analysis As time series data arises in a wide variety of research fields, ranging from stock market forecasting to heart rate variability analysis, numerous tools have been developed to identify patterns in massive, continuous time series data. However, it would be time-consuming and sometimes insufficient to carry out individual analysis and compare simple statistics on the time series data to look for meaningful patterns, especially when little is known about the underlying data structure. As a result, the highly comparative time series analysis ( HCTSA ) toolkit is implemented to allow automatic data mining for our fly behavioural time series. HCTSA systematically performs over 7,700 statistical analyses, adopted from literatures of different disciplines, on each time series 12 . This creates a M x N feature matrix, where M is the number of labelled time series samples and N is the number of statistical operations (also called time series features). Following the massive feature extraction, machine learning tasks such as principal component analysis and classification algorithms can then be performed to quantify similarity between the differently labelled groups (Figure 2) . F2. The HCTSA Workflow Figure 2. Highly Comparative Time Series Analysis (HCTSA) workflow. A set of time-series data is labelled and used as input dataset. HCTSA computes over 7,000 operations on each time-series data to create a MxN feature matrix (M = number of timeseries, N = number of operations). After feature extraction, statistical learning tools such as dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms can be used to analyse the data. In addition to HCTSA , it is also possible to compute a reduced number of operations using Canonical Time-series Characteristics ( Catch22 ), a toolbox that has preselected 22 most representative time-series features from the HCTSA library 13 . This significantly decreases the computation time. Therefore, Catch22 is carried out first in every analysis, and HCSTA is performed if the Catch22 yields interesting results. An advantage of using HCTSA compared to other methods such as deep neutral network on time series classification is that HCTSA encompasses interpretable and well-documented features. This allows useful understanding of the factors that potentially differentiates deep and light sleep in Drosophila . It also provides scope for incorporating a simplistic algorithm to the Ethoscope software that can apply the selected features on newly recorded time series data to indicate sleep stage.

Data processing, exploratory analysis and visualisation tasks were carried out using Python or MATLAB on a 16 GB MacBook Pro. 2.1 Ethoscope Data Data was downloaded from the remote database of the Gilestro Lab group.

To intuitively look for potential characteristics of each variable, the mean and confidence interval of variable value averaged over 210 fly recordings were computed and plotted over time (Figure 3) . Figure 3A shows that mean velocity is highly cyclical, which is expected as the Drosophila activity level follows a circadian rhythm. Fly with a velocity value under 1 is considered to be immobile, and long periods of immobility (i.e., sleep) are typically observed during the mid-day (hour 2-9) and early-night (hour 14-18). Interestingly, the x and phi variables also display a similar pattern that has lower mean values at these sleep periods (Figure 3B & 3C) , although the corresponding degree of uncertainty is much higher. For w , h and area , a sudden change in value when switching to dark is seen (Figure 3D & 3E & 3F) . This could be the result of a technical defect as the camera becomes less capable of detecting fly boundaries in dim lighting. The overall area may be larger during night than day due to this problem. F3. Variables over Time A) mean velocity B) x C) phi D) w E) h F) area Figure 3A. Mean Velocity Over Time Figure 3B.

Area of Oval Mask Over Time 3.1.2 Classifying Set Periods in Mid-day and Early-night Previous studies have shown that the Drosophila brain activity level is lower during night-time sleep than day-time sleep 1 , suggesting that deeper sleep stages are more likely to occur during the night. To exploratively investigate whether our multivariate data reflects this hypothesis, time series were extracted from specific times during the mid-day and early-night for HCTSA analysis. Initially, 20-min periods were taken and subjected to feature extraction, but over 30% of HCTSA operations were not able to yield good-quality features as most operations were designed for analysing longer time series. Therefore, 60-min periods were taken from hour 6-7 (mid-day) and hour 13-14 (early-night), and they labelled as \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018dark\u2019 accordingly. Since HCTSA only supports single-variable analysis, a HCTSA computation was done for each of the mean velocity , x , phi and area variables, producing four different feature matrices. Three different classifiers were used: linear support vector machine ( SVM ), decision tree, and K-nearest neighbours ( kNN ) (Table 1) . SVM consistently yielded the highest classification accuracy amongst the three. Of the four variables included, mean velocity and area time series are the most distinguishable between the two time periods. However, the high classification rates for area may be due to bias in image recognition, and so only the mean velocity is considered. T1. Classifcation rates Table 1.

It would therefore be useful to robustly define and extract sleep sessions from the data for a more stringent analysis. Initially, the five-minute rule 2 was applied to identify sleep, where periods of at least five continuous minutes of inactivity are labelled as asleep. However, using this metric alone to extract sleep sessions for time series analysis has two limitations: 1) successive inactive periods may be disrupted by short bursts of activities, resulting in fragmented sleep periods and hence fewer time series data of at least 60-min available for HCTSA feature extraction, 2) it could potentially filter out lighter sleep stages, and the remaining mean velocity time series would inherently all have little fluctuations, making it difficult to distinguish between them. To overcome these limitations, another metric for defining sleep sessions was developed. In addition to the five-minute rule, short bursts (\u2264 5min) of activities are allowed between inactive sleep periods and are still labelled as asleep. This allows longer periods of sleep to be extracted for HCTSA analysis and classification. Examples of the time series produced are shown in Figure 4 . It can be seen that bursts of activity occur periodically during both day-sleep and night-sleep, and nuances between the two are searched for using HCTSA analysis. F4. Time Series plot Figure 4. Plotting time series. 3.3 Classifying Sleep at Different Parts of the Day 3.3.1 Two-class classification Sleep sessions that are at least 60-min long were selected from mean velocity data, and the first 60-min of which were extracted. This is to allow all time series to be the same length so that classification would not rely on length-dependent features but on more intrinsic properties. A total of 991 time series (M=991) were produced; 388 of which are day-time sleep and 603 of which are night-time sleep, and they were labelled as \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 accordingly. HCTSA successfully computed 5202 features (N=5202) on each time series. Thus, a 991 x 5202 (M x N) feature matrix was generated for this two-class data. Classification on the full feature space using a 10-fold linear SVM classifier yielded a mean balanced accuracy of 73.01%. To visualise and examine the feature space, dimensionality reduction algorithms including principal component analysis ( PCA ) and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ( t-SNE ) were employed. Two-dimensional representations by the two methods are shown in Figure 5 . Additionally, a linear SVM classification is performed on each dimensional space, and the individual and combined classification accuracies are indicated on the axis. In the PCA plot, time series data for night-time sleep (red dots) are more spread out than those for day-time sleep (blue dots) (Figure 5A) . Interestingly, night-time sleep data embedded by t-SNE follows a bimodal distribution to some degree, with one of the peak positions being similar to that for day-time sleep data (Figure 5B) . This provides the first evidence that two types of sleep may exist: one occurs mostly at night and the other can occur at both day and night. F5. PCA & T-SNE A) PCA B) t-SNE Figure 5. Low Dimensional Representations of the Feature Space. A) Principal Component Analysis. B) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding Figure 5. Low Dimensional Representations of the Feature Space. A) Principal Component Analysis. B) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding To investigate whether classification is driven by certain types of features, HCSTA features were divided into subsets based on the type of properties they measure and then compared by the accuracies of linear- SVM classification (Figure 6) . Notably, location- and spread-dependent features yielded the highest accuracies. Location-dependent features are those that change under mean shifts of a time series, while spread-dependent features are those that change under rescaling about their mean 3 . Both types describe basic statistics of the distribution of time series. This indicates that the differences between day-time sleep and night-time sleep may be explained by simple features rather than complex dynamical properties of the time series. F6. Feature Dependence Next, each of the 5202 features was individually assessed for their ability to separate the two labelled classes using linear SVM classification. The performance distribution was compared to a set of randomized null features to evaluate the statistical significance of the result (Figure 7) . It is shown that only a relatively small number of features yield high classification accuracies. F7. Distribution of Accuracies Figure 7. Distribution of Accuracies across all features The 16 most discriminative features and their class distributions are visualized in Figure 8 . The \u2018dark\u2019-labelled data of several features, including [894] EN_DistributionEntropy_raw_ks , [6141] PP_Compare_rav3_kscn_adiff and [6253] PP_Compare_resample_2_1_swms , have exhibited the bimodal distribution that was observed in the previous t-SNE plot (Figure 5B) . It can be more clearly seen from these features that the data are roughly organised into two clusters, one containing almost exclusively \u2018dark\u2019 labels and the other containing both \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 labels. F8. Top Features Figure 8. Top 16 Features. 3.3.2 Three-class classification Referring back to the mean velocity over time plot in Figure 3A , low-activity periods also occur during late-night (hour 20-22) but with higher average velocities than early-night sleep. It is therefore hypothesized that the two clusters seen for night-time sleep data may attribute to differences in early-night and late-night sleep. Therefore, the same dataset used in section 3.3.1 were re-labelled with \u2018light\u2019, \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 and \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019. The number of time series data for each class is 388, 477 and 126, respectively, indicating that sleep take place predominately during the first part of the night. Three-class classification using linear SVM was performed on the 991 x 5202 feature matrix, yielding a mean balanced accuracy of 58.65%. A confusion matrix was created and visualised to determine how well the labels are distinguished from one another (Figure 9) . It is shown that \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 are well-discerned with true-positive rates over 70%, but \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019 is much more ambiguous. F9. Confusion Matrix Figure 9. Confusion Matrix. Low-dimensional embedding of the three-class feature space are visualized in Figure 10A & 10B . In contrast to classification on the full feature space, \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019 data seem to be discriminable from the other two classes in low-dimensional space according to distributions in the first components of PCA and t-SNE .

Top Features Each feature is individually assessed, and class distributions of the top 16 performing features are visualised in Figure 11A . Distributions of the two \u2018dark\u2019 classes are noticeably segregated, and \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 data points are mostly found in one cluster. This confirms the hypothesis that night-sleep patterns are different between early- and late-night. In addition, most of these features produced similar distributions, with \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019 having the highest mean and \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 the lowest. To understand the similarities between top features, a pairwise correlation matrix was computed for the top 40 features (Figure 11B) . The matrix was clustered by the absolute correlation coefficient values, leading to only 3 clusters. Hence, these features are largely related to each other and measure similar properties of the time series. The most representative features based on classification performance and feature dependency are: [17] burstiness_Goh , [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_olapint , [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent , and [6112] PP_Compare_rav2_kscn_peaksepx . A) Top 16 Features B) Pairwise Correlation Matrix of 40 Top Features Lastly, the four representative features are individually inspected to understand in detail how each assigns values to time series (Figure 12) . For each feature, the operation was run on un-normalised time series (rather than the unit interval normalized values in the HCTSA feature matrix) to produce a distribution plot of the actual outputs. Keywords that describe the type of property the feature measures are indicated in the plot title. Snippets of time series ordered by the output values are also plotted to help interpret how the classes are distinguished. F12. Features of Interest A) Burstiness B) Distribution C) Sliding Window D) Rolling Average [17] burstiness_Goh and [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_olapint are both location- and spread dependent features that measure time series distribution, and their resulting plots are extremely similar (Figure 12A & 12B) . [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent is a measure of stationarity which slides a window along the time series, calculates the distribution entropy of each window and outputs an overall histogram entropy value (Figure 12C) . Therefore, it is also a measure of distribution and is highly correlated to [17] burstiness_Goh . On the other hand, [6112] PP_Compare_rav2_kscn_peaksepx is a combination of [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_ olapint and [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent , which applies a running average transformation (window length = 2) to the time series and quantifies differences between the kernel-smoothed and fitted distribution of the processed data (Figure 12D) . As a result, all four operations evaluates similar properties of the time series. Of which, [17] burstiness_Goh produces the highest classification accuracy and so is considered for further interpretation in the Discussion page. van Alphen B, Yap MHW, Kirszenblat L, Kottler B, van Swinderen B.

To intuitively look for potential characteristics of each variable, the mean and confidence interval of variable value averaged over 210 fly recordings were computed and plotted over time (Figure 3) . Figure 3A shows that mean velocity is highly cyclical, which is expected as the Drosophila activity level follows a circadian rhythm. Fly with a velocity value under 1 is considered to be immobile, and long periods of immobility (i.e., sleep) are typically observed during the mid-day (hour 2-9) and early-night (hour 14-18). Interestingly, the x and phi variables also display a similar pattern that has lower mean values at these sleep periods (Figure 3B & 3C) , although the corresponding degree of uncertainty is much higher. For w , h and area , a sudden change in value when switching to dark is seen (Figure 3D & 3E & 3F) . This could be the result of a technical defect as the camera becomes less capable of detecting fly boundaries in dim lighting. The overall area may be larger during night than day due to this problem.","title":"3.1.1 Patterns of each Variable"},{"location":"results/#f3-variables-over-time","text":"A) mean velocity B) x C) phi D) w E) h F) area Figure 3A.

To exploratively investigate whether our multivariate data reflects this hypothesis, time series were extracted from specific times during the mid-day and early-night for HCTSA analysis. Initially, 20-min periods were taken and subjected to feature extraction, but over 30% of HCTSA operations were not able to yield good-quality features as most operations were designed for analysing longer time series. Therefore, 60-min periods were taken from hour 6-7 (mid-day) and hour 13-14 (early-night), and they labelled as \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018dark\u2019 accordingly. Since HCTSA only supports single-variable analysis, a HCTSA computation was done for each of the mean velocity , x , phi and area variables, producing four different feature matrices. Three different classifiers were used: linear support vector machine ( SVM ), decision tree, and K-nearest neighbours ( kNN ) (Table 1) . SVM consistently yielded the highest classification accuracy amongst the three. Of the four variables included, mean velocity and area time series are the most distinguishable between the two time periods. However, the high classification rates for area may be due to bias in image recognition, and so only the mean velocity is considered.","title":"3.1.2 Classifying Set Periods in Mid-day and Early-night"},{"location":"results/#t1-classifcation-rates","text":"Table 1.

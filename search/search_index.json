The mean velocity variable directly relates to the activity level (or mobility), and flies with mean velocity below a certain threshold is generally considered as asleep. It is hence found that Drosophila typically sleep during mid-day and the first few hours of the night. Sleep during the day has also been seen in previous fly studies and is known as the mid-day siesta 1 , which is thought to be an adaptive response to minimize exposure to heat 2 3 4 . Flies also exhibit sleep behaviours during late-night (around hour 20-22) followed by a few hours of low-level activities. Using the mean velocity as a reference, it is seen that x and phi also follow a similar pattern. Flies tend to be located at x positions around 0.2-0.3 during mid-day siesta and early-night sleep, which is roughly where the food is placed. It is likely because sleep happens after feeding, as food consumption has been thought to induce sleepiness 5 . The phi angle is also generally lower (i.e., closer to horizontal) during sleep and consistently higher when active, which is likely due to increased turning when walking back and forth in the tube. Size-related variables including w , h and area all have slightly decreased values during mid-day siesta. Shrinking in size due to fly crouching down when resting has also been observed by previous research 6 . However, these measures during the night are less reliable for interpretation in this study as the oval masks are not well assigned in dim lights. Although the x and phi variables may be useful in distinguishing sleep and awake states, they seem to be less discriminable when trying to identify deep and light sleep stages according to the classification results in section 3.1.2 . This study therefore focused on univariate analysis of the mean velocity variable to explore potential indicators of sleep stages. 4.2 Sleep Depth and Burstiness of Activity In this study, a different way of identifying sleep was developed which allows short bursts of activity during sleep. This is to potentially include more light sleep, that has higher activity levels, into our time series data for analysis. Sleep sessions are extracted from different parts of the day using this method, and results from section 3.3.2 showed that sleep can be relatively well-differentiated between mid-day, early-night and late-night. Time series for mid-day and early-night sleep are generally organised into single clusters, while late-night sleep data is more distributed with a range of characteristics. The hypothesis is that the majority of sleep during early-night is at a deeper stage and the majority for mid-day is at a lighter stage, and both stages can occur during late-night. Investigation of the time series features in section 3.3.2 revealed that differences between the three classes may be explained by a small amount of simple, location- and spread-dependent features. These top features are also highly correlated and can be narrowed down to a single representative feature: burstiness. Burstiness describes the intermittent short timeframes of activity following long periods of inactivity 7 . It is often measured by the Fano factor which is a ratio between the variance and mean of burst counts. The orginal burstiness statistics is proposed by Goh and Barabasi 8 and is defined as \\[ \\Delta \\equiv \\frac{\\operatorname{sgn}\\left(\\sigma_{\\tau}-m_{\\tau}\\right)}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\left|P(\\tau)-P_{\\mathrm{P}}(\\tau)\\right| d \\tau \\] where \\(\\Delta\\) is the burstiness parameter, \\(\\operatorname{sgn}\\) is a function that extracts the sign of a number, \\(m_{T}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{T}\\) are the mean and standard deviation of \\(P(\\tau)\\) , \\(P(\\tau)\\) is the given time series, and \\(P_{\\mathrm{P}}(\\tau)\\) is a random, time-independent series that follows an exponential distribution. This equation is adapted by Fulcher and Jones (12) and incorporated into HCTSA with equation \\[ B=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\tau}-m_{\\tau}}{\\sigma_{\\tau}+m_{\\tau}} \\] where \\(B\\) is the burstiness parameter, \\(m_{T}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{T}\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the time series. For the three classes, late-night sleep yields the highest mean burstiness, and early-night sleep yields the lowest. This suggests that early-night sleep time series have fewer significantly enhanced activity levels, which corresponds to the reduced mobility known for deep sleep 9 10 . In addition, sleep has also been associated to increased arousal thresholds (or decreased sensory responsiveness) 6 11 , and previous work by the Gilestro Lab Group has shown that late-night sleep exhibits the greatest response to stimuli compared to mid-day siesta and early-night sleep 12 . This is concordant to the fact that late-night sleep has the highest burstiness. However, responsiveness of early-night sleep seems to be greater than siesta, which contradicts the order of their burstiness values. More work needs to be carried out to determine whether the arousal threshold is correlated to burstiness of activity during sleep. Overall, burstiness may serve as a possible indicator for sleep depth and help to distinguish sleep stages. 4.3 Limitations and Aspects for Improvements The use of HCTSA for time series analysis has greatly facilitated our exploration for nuances in sleep. However, it also posed many restrictions to the analysis, particularly during the data curation process. First, most HCTSA operations prefers longer time series as inputs, and so sleep sessions are taken in windows of 60 minutes using the more forgiving sleep metric. This excludes shorter sleep periods which may be more typical for Drosophila sleep. One solution is to obtain per-second data from the Ethoscope database but its downloading and analysis would be more time-consuming and not suitable for this short exploratory project. Secondly, it is known for mammals that sleep stages exists in cycles and have varying lengths 13 14 , but HCTSA operations return single statistical values for a given time series which may overlook such details. Lastly, HCTSA only allows single-variate analysis, and multivariable analysis that includes other Ethoscope parameters could potentially improve the classification rate. Cao W, Edery I.

Introducion 1.1 Sleep Behaviours in Drosophila Melanogaster Sleep is an important yet complex physiological process that occurs in virtually every animal that has been studied so far, but its underpinnings and functions remain elusive despite the rapidly developing effort towards sleep analysis. Mammalian sleep is known to be a multistage process with varying sleep depth associated with changes in neuronal activity 1 2 3 . In humans, for example, electroencephalographic ( EEG ) recordings can be used to identify the different sleep stages which circulate between wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement ( REM ). It is believed that different sleep stages may serve distinct biological functions. For instance, evidence has shown that deep sleep contributes to bodily recovery and growth 4 , while REM sleep is essential to cognitive functions such as memory and learning 5 . Definitions EEG PE Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is a method that measures electrical activity in the brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp (Wikipedia) . A proboscis in insects refers to the tubular mouthpart used for feeding and sucking. Proboscis extension ( PE ) can either occur spontaneously or in response to antennal stimulation (Wikipedia) . Over the last few decades, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been an increasingly popular model organism to understand how sleep is regulated by internal and external stimuli and how it affects other biological functions. The simplicity, cost-effectiveness, rapid developmental time, and relevance to human genetics and physiology have made Drosophila an indispensable tool 6 . In most current studies, the sleeping state in Drosophila is defined by a simple metric: immobility for more than five minutes 7 , and it is often assumed to be homogenous throughout. Nevertheless, there has been increasing evidence that sleep in Drosophila is also a dynamic process with differing sleep intensities 8 . Methods including EEG recordings, arousal-testing, and Proboscis Extension ( PE ) measurements have been used together to show that Drosophila exhibits a deep sleep stage which is characterised by 1) reduced neural activity, 2) increased immobility, 3) increased arousal threshold, and 4) stereotypical PE movement, namely the periodic extensions and retractions of the proboscis 9 10 . These studies also indicated that Drosophila sleep follows a circadian rhythm, where flies sleep the most during start of the night, and it is also under homeostatic control as sleep deprivation leads to increased sleep amount and reduced sleep latency 10 . In this study, we turn to a novel method of measuring Drosophila behaviours using the Ethoscope, developed in the Gilestro lab , which can track the movement of a single fly housed in a glass tube 11 . This provides a simple, non-invasive, and high-throughput measurement of the external behaviour of sleep. The aim is to try and identify patterns in Drosophila locomotive data that can infer distinct sleep stages as indicated in previous research. 1.2 The Ethoscope An ethoscope contains a hardware that video-records the fly in a longitudinal glass tube and a software to track its activity in real-time by applying an oval mask over the fly with machine vision algorithms (Figure 1A & 1B) . The software can therefore track the x , y coordinates, width w and height h of the oval mask, and the angle phi between the line of W and the horizontal axis of the tube arena (Figure 1C) . This results in five different series of values recorded over time, which are called time series, for each fly (Figure 1D) . The ethoscope software also includes algorithms to calculate the maximum velocity and mean velocity at each time point, as well as behavioural annotators to indicate whether the fly is moving, exhibiting micro-movement, or immobile at a given time point. F1. Fly Behavioural Tracking with Ethoscope Figure 1. Fly Behavioural Tracking with Ethoscope. A) Rendered drawing of an Ethoscope device. B) A graphic representation of the oval mask and the variables x, y, w, h and phi of a single fly. C) A snippet of the example outputs of the Ethoscope. t is the time variable. 1.3 Time Series Analysis As time series data arises in a wide variety of research fields, ranging from stock market forecasting to heart rate variability analysis, numerous tools have been developed to identify patterns in massive, continuous time series data. However, it would be time-consuming and sometimes insufficient to carry out individual analysis and compare simple statistics on the time series data to look for meaningful patterns, especially when little is known about the underlying data structure. As a result, the highly comparative time series analysis ( HCTSA ) toolkit is implemented to allow automatic data mining for our fly behavioural time series. HCTSA systematically performs over 7,700 statistical analyses, adopted from literatures of different disciplines, on each time series 12 . This creates a M x N feature matrix, where M is the number of labelled time series samples and N is the number of statistical operations (also called time series features). Following the massive feature extraction, machine learning tasks such as principal component analysis and classification algorithms can then be performed to quantify similarity between the differently labelled groups (Figure 2) . F2. The HCTSA Workflow Figure 2. Highly Comparative Time Series Analysis (HCTSA) workflow. A set of time-series data is labelled and used as input dataset. HCTSA computes over 7,000 operations on each time-series data to create a MxN feature matrix (M = number of timeseries, N = number of operations). After feature extraction, statistical learning tools such as dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms can be used to analyse the data. In addition to HCTSA , it is also possible to compute a reduced number of operations using Canonical Time-series Characteristics ( Catch22 ), a toolbox that has preselected 22 most representative time-series features from the HCTSA library 13 . This significantly decreases the computation time. Therefore, Catch22 is carried out first in every analysis, and HCSTA is performed if the Catch22 yields interesting results. An advantage of using HCTSA compared to other methods such as deep neutral network on time series classification is that HCTSA encompasses interpretable and well-documented features. This allows useful understanding of the factors that potentially differentiates deep and light sleep in Drosophila . It also provides scope for incorporating a simplistic algorithm to the Ethoscope software that can apply the selected features on newly recorded time series data to indicate sleep stage.

Introducion"},{"location":"introduction/#11-sleep-behaviours-in-drosophila-melanogaster","text":"Sleep is an important yet complex physiological process that occurs in virtually every animal that has been studied so far, but its underpinnings and functions remain elusive despite the rapidly developing effort towards sleep analysis. Mammalian sleep is known to be a multistage process with varying sleep depth associated with changes in neuronal activity 1 2 3 . In humans, for example, electroencephalographic ( EEG ) recordings can be used to identify the different sleep stages which circulate between wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement ( REM ). It is believed that different sleep stages may serve distinct biological functions. For instance, evidence has shown that deep sleep contributes to bodily recovery and growth 4 , while REM sleep is essential to cognitive functions such as memory and learning 5 . Definitions EEG PE Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is a method that measures electrical activity in the brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp (Wikipedia) . A proboscis in insects refers to the tubular mouthpart used for feeding and sucking. Proboscis extension ( PE ) can either occur spontaneously or in response to antennal stimulation (Wikipedia) . Over the last few decades, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been an increasingly popular model organism to understand how sleep is regulated by internal and external stimuli and how it affects other biological functions. The simplicity, cost-effectiveness, rapid developmental time, and relevance to human genetics and physiology have made Drosophila an indispensable tool 6 . In most current studies, the sleeping state in Drosophila is defined by a simple metric: immobility for more than five minutes 7 , and it is often assumed to be homogenous throughout. Nevertheless, there has been increasing evidence that sleep in Drosophila is also a dynamic process with differing sleep intensities 8 . Methods including EEG recordings, arousal-testing, and Proboscis Extension ( PE ) measurements have been used together to show that Drosophila exhibits a deep sleep stage which is characterised by 1) reduced neural activity, 2) increased immobility, 3) increased arousal threshold, and 4) stereotypical PE movement, namely the periodic extensions and retractions of the proboscis 9 10 . These studies also indicated that Drosophila sleep follows a circadian rhythm, where flies sleep the most during start of the night, and it is also under homeostatic control as sleep deprivation leads to increased sleep amount and reduced sleep latency 10 . In this study, we turn to a novel method of measuring Drosophila behaviours using the Ethoscope, developed in the Gilestro lab , which can track the movement of a single fly housed in a glass tube 11 . This provides a simple, non-invasive, and high-throughput measurement of the external behaviour of sleep. The aim is to try and identify patterns in Drosophila locomotive data that can infer distinct sleep stages as indicated in previous research.","title":"1.1 Sleep Behaviours in Drosophila Melanogaster"},{"location":"introduction/#12-the-ethoscope","text":"An ethoscope contains a hardware that video-records the fly in a longitudinal glass tube and a software to track its activity in real-time by applying an oval mask over the fly with machine vision algorithms (Figure 1A & 1B) . The software can therefore track the x , y coordinates, width w and height h of the oval mask, and the angle phi between the line of W and the horizontal axis of the tube arena (Figure 1C) . This results in five different series of values recorded over time, which are called time series, for each fly (Figure 1D) . The ethoscope software also includes algorithms to calculate the maximum velocity and mean velocity at each time point, as well as behavioural annotators to indicate whether the fly is moving, exhibiting micro-movement, or immobile at a given time point.","title":"1.2 The Ethoscope"},{"location":"introduction/#f1-fly-behavioural-tracking-with-ethoscope","text":"Figure 1.

However, it would be time-consuming and sometimes insufficient to carry out individual analysis and compare simple statistics on the time series data to look for meaningful patterns, especially when little is known about the underlying data structure. As a result, the highly comparative time series analysis ( HCTSA ) toolkit is implemented to allow automatic data mining for our fly behavioural time series. HCTSA systematically performs over 7,700 statistical analyses, adopted from literatures of different disciplines, on each time series 12 . This creates a M x N feature matrix, where M is the number of labelled time series samples and N is the number of statistical operations (also called time series features). Following the massive feature extraction, machine learning tasks such as principal component analysis and classification algorithms can then be performed to quantify similarity between the differently labelled groups (Figure 2) .","title":"1.3 Time Series Analysis"},{"location":"introduction/#f2-the-hctsa-workflow","text":"Figure 2. Highly Comparative Time Series Analysis (HCTSA) workflow. A set of time-series data is labelled and used as input dataset. HCTSA computes over 7,000 operations on each time-series data to create a MxN feature matrix (M = number of timeseries, N = number of operations). After feature extraction, statistical learning tools such as dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms can be used to analyse the data. In addition to HCTSA , it is also possible to compute a reduced number of operations using Canonical Time-series Characteristics ( Catch22 ), a toolbox that has preselected 22 most representative time-series features from the HCTSA library 13 . This significantly decreases the computation time. Therefore, Catch22 is carried out first in every analysis, and HCSTA is performed if the Catch22 yields interesting results. An advantage of using HCTSA compared to other methods such as deep neutral network on time series classification is that HCTSA encompasses interpretable and well-documented features. This allows useful understanding of the factors that potentially differentiates deep and light sleep in Drosophila . It also provides scope for incorporating a simplistic algorithm to the Ethoscope software that can apply the selected features on newly recorded time series data to indicate sleep stage.

The HCTSA Workflow "},{"location":"methods/","text":"All data for this project is retrieved from previous experiments done by the Gilestro Lab group. Computationally intensive work in this project was performed on remote servers. Catch22 analysis was performed locally. Highly comparative time-series analysis ( HCTSA ) was submitted as jobs to be run on the Imperial Research Computing Service with 4 CPUs and 64 GB memory. Data processing, exploratory analysis and visualisation tasks were carried out using Python or MATLAB on a 16 GB MacBook Pro. 2.1 Ethoscope Data Data was downloaded from the remote database of the Gilestro Lab group. The dataset describes 210 male CantonS flies that were raised at 25\u02daC on standard yeast and sugar media, each fly was then placed into a 70 mm \u00d7 5 mm \u00d7 3 mm (length \u00d7 external diameter \u00d7 internal diameter) glass tube containing food. Groups of 20 flies were placed for each Ethoscope in 25\u02daC incubators and were video recorded under a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark conditions over several days. The experiment was originally designed for sleep-deprivation studies, but sleep distributions was not applied until 4 days of normal conditions. Day 1-3 (hour 24-96) was therefore extracted (day 0 was also omitted to allow time for flies to adjust), and data was binned to 60 seconds used for shorter downloading and analysis time. 2.2 Data Processing and Exploration The Ethoscope generates five variables (X, Y, Phi, W, and H) for each recording of fly activity over time. It also produces the maximum and mean velocities calculated from the distance travelled by the fly over unit time. Movement in the vertical axis is restricted as the fly moves within a longitudinal tube, so the Y variable is omitted. The oval mask does not have any directionality, hence the raw Phi values which are between 0 and 180 were normalised into values between 0 and 90 to describe whether a fly is horizontal or vertical. Additionally, area of the oval mask was calculated from the W and H values. These variables of potential interest, namely the mean velocity , x , y , phi , w , h and area , were used for exploratory analysis to identify which ones may be indicative of unique sleeping patterns. 2.3 Time Series Analysis 2.3.1 Feature Extraction For each time series dataset, three M x 1 cell arrays were created in MATLAB to specify the 1) time series data, 2) class labels, 3) identifiers of the time series. These were used to initialise an HCTSA .mat with an empty M x N table. Catch22 or HCTSA operations were performed on the HCTSA .mat file using the TS_compute function. Each operation returned a value for every time series and was saved to the .mat file. The resulting HCTSA matrix was normalised and bad-quality features were removed using the TS_normalize function 1 2 . A Catch22 analysis typically takes about 5-7 minutes (run locally), an HCTSA takes around 3-4 hours (run on a HPC). 2.3.2 Low Dimensional Representations The HCTSA software provides a TS_PlotLowDim function which performs and visualises low-dimensional representations of the feature space. Two dimensionality reduction methods were considered, namely principal component analysis ( PCA ) and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ( t-SNE ). Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) PCA measures covariance between data points and transforms them onto the so-called principal components (PCs) which are orthogonal lines that capture the most variance of the data. It helps to reduce noise caused by outliers and reveal the underlying relationships between data points 3 . t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding ( t-SNE ) t-SNE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. It calculates the similarity between each pair of data points, represents them in terms of probability distributions, and then minimises the difference between the probability distributions in the original and lower dimensional space. As a result, it allows detection of local similarities in complex and non-linear datasets 4 . 2.3.3 Classification The TS_Classify function was used to classify assigned class labels of a given normalised HCTSA data matrix. Three types of classifiers are considered: linear support vector machine ( SVM ), decision tree, and k-nearest neighbours ( kNN ). All classification performances are cross-validated with a fold number of 10 (i.e., dataset is split into 10 groups for training/testing in each random shuffle), giving a mean balanced classification accuracy. Linear Support Vector Machine (linear- SVM ) SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds optimal hyperplanes within the feature space to separate data points of different classes. Linear-SVMs are commonly used whose hyperplane is essentially a straight line 5 . Descision Tree Decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts the value or class of an output variable based on several input variables. Data is continuously split according to a certain parameter to create a decision tree. The tree has nodes and leaves, where leaves are the decisions or the output and nodes are where the data is split. This method is commonly used in data mining as it is good for describing and generalising data 6 . k-Nearest Neighbours ( kNN ) kNN is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that uses proximity of data points to make predications about the class labels. It identifies the nearest neighbours of a given query point based on a chosen distance metric and assigns a label to the class. The most commonly used metric is the Euclidean distance which measures a straight line between two points 7 . 2.3.4 Feature Analysis The feature sets were compared using the TS_CompareFeatureSets function, and top features were probed in detail using several functions including TS_TopFeatures and TS_FeatureSummary .

To intuitively look for potential characteristics of each variable, the mean and confidence interval of variable value averaged over 210 fly recordings were computed and plotted over time (Figure 3) . Figure 3A shows that mean velocity is highly cyclical, which is expected as the Drosophila activity level follows a circadian rhythm. Fly with a velocity value under 1 is considered to be immobile, and long periods of immobility (i.e., sleep) are typically observed during the mid-day (hour 2-9) and early-night (hour 14-18). Interestingly, the x and phi variables also display a similar pattern that has lower mean values at these sleep periods (Figure 3B & 3C) , although the corresponding degree of uncertainty is much higher. For w , h and area , a sudden change in value when switching to dark is seen (Figure 3D & 3E & 3F) . This could be the result of a technical defect as the camera becomes less capable of detecting fly boundaries in dim lighting. The overall area may be larger during night than day due to this problem. F3. Variables over Time A) mean velocity B) x C) phi D) w E) h F) area Figure 3A. Mean Velocity of Movement Over Time.

To exploratively investigate whether our multivariate data reflects this hypothesis, time series were extracted from specific times during the mid-day and early-night for HCTSA analysis. Initially, 20-min periods were taken and subjected to feature extraction, but over 30% of HCTSA operations were not able to yield good-quality features as most operations were designed for analysing longer time series. Therefore, 60-min periods were taken from hour 6-7 (mid-day) and hour 13-14 (early-night), and they were labelled as \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018dark\u2019 accordingly. Since HCTSA only supports single-variable analysis, a HCTSA computation was done for each of the mean velocity , x , phi and area variables, producing four different feature matrices. Three different classifiers were used: linear support vector machine ( SVM ), decision tree, and K-nearest neighbours ( kNN ) (Table 1) . SVM consistently yielded the highest classification accuracy amongst the three. Of the four variables included, mean velocity and area time series are the most distinguishable between the two time periods. However, the high classification rates for area may be due to bias in image recognition, and so only the mean velocity is considered. T1. Classifcation rates Table 1. Classification Rates for Time Periods between Mid-day vs Early-night Mean Accuracy of 10-fold Classification Variable SVM Decision Tree kNN mean velocity 73.91% 68.15% 69.53% x 67.89% 62.86% 59.21% phi 60.91% 57.97% 57.35% area 74.86% 71.97% 67.48% 3.2 Sleep Data Curation 3.2.1 Identifying Sleep Sessions Sleep can not only occur during mid-day and early-night but also at any time throughout the day. It would therefore be useful to robustly define and extract sleep sessions from the data for a more stringent analysis. Initially, the five-minute rule 2 was applied to identify sleep, where periods of at least five continuous minutes of inactivity are labelled as asleep. However, using this metric alone to extract sleep sessions for time series analysis has two limitations: 1) successive inactive periods may be disrupted by short bursts of activities, resulting in fragmented sleep periods and hence fewer time series data of at least 60-min available for HCTSA feature extraction, 2) it could potentially filter out lighter sleep stages, and the remaining mean velocity time series would inherently all have little fluctuations, making it difficult to distinguish between them. To overcome these limitations, another metric for defining sleep sessions was developed. In addition to the five-minute rule, short bursts (\u2264 5min) of activities are allowed between inactive sleep periods and are still labelled as asleep. This allows longer periods of sleep to be extracted for HCTSA analysis and classification. Examples of the time series produced are shown in Figure 4 . It can be seen that bursts of activity occur periodically during both day-sleep and night-sleep, and nuances between the two are searched for using HCTSA analysis. F4. Time Series plot Figure 4.

Note, the y range of the time series is normalised to be between 0-1 and does not represent the absolute values. 3.3 Classifying Sleep at Different Parts of the Day 3.3.1 Two-class classification Sleep sessions that are at least 60-min long were selected from mean velocity data, and the first 60-min of which were extracted. This is to allow all time series to be the same length so that classification would not rely on length-dependent features but on more intrinsic properties. A total of 991 time series (M=991) were produced; 388 of which are day-time sleep and 603 of which are night-time sleep, and they were labelled as \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018dark\u2019 accordingly. HCTSA successfully computed 5202 features (N=5202) on each time series. Thus, a 991 x 5202 (M x N) feature matrix was generated for this two-class data. Classification on the full feature space using a 10-fold linear SVM classifier yielded a mean balanced accuracy of 73.01%. To visualise and examine the feature space, dimensionality reduction algorithms including principal component analysis ( PCA ) and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ( t-SNE ) were employed. Two-dimensional representations by the two methods are shown in Figure 5 . Additionally, a linear SVM classification was performed on each dimensional space, and the individual and combined classification accuracies are indicated on the axis. In the PCA plot, time series data for night-time sleep (red dots) are more spread out than those for day-time sleep (blue dots) (Figure 5A) . Interestingly, night-time sleep data embedded by t-SNE follows a bimodal distribution to some degree, with one of the peak positions being similar to that for day-time sleep data (Figure 5B) . This provides the first evidence that two types of sleep may exist: one occurs mostly at night and the other can occur at both day and night. F5. PCA & T-SNE A) PCA B) t-SNE Figure 5.

Combined accuracy for the 2D space is indicated in the plot title. To investigate whether classification is driven by certain types of features, HCSTA features were divided into subsets based on the type of properties they measure and then compared by the accuracies of linear SVM classification (Figure 6) . Notably, location- and spread-dependent features yielded the highest accuracies. Location-dependent features are those that change under mean shifts of a time series, while spread-dependent features are those that change under rescaling about their mean 3 . Both types describe basic statistics of the distribution of time series. This indicates that the differences between day-time sleep and night-time sleep may be explained by simple features rather than complex dynamical properties of the time series. F6. Feature Dependence Figure 6. Comparison of Feature-Set Dependence for the Two-Class Problem. Subsets of the HCTSA features were extracted based on the types of analysis they conduct. Linear SVM classification was then performed on each subset of features and on the subset-excluded sets, and their balanced accuracies were compared with that of the full feature set ('all'). Next, each of the 5202 features was individually assessed for their ability to separate the two labelled classes using linear SVM classification. The performance distribution was compared to a set of randomized null features to evaluate the statistical significance of the result (Figure 7) . It is shown that only a relatively small number of features yield high classification accuracies. F7. Distribution of Accuracies Figure 7. Distribution of Accuracies across all features.

It can be more clearly seen from these features that the data are roughly organised into two clusters, one containing almost exclusively \u2018dark\u2019 labels and the other containing both \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 labels. F8. Top Features Figure 8. Top 16 Features for the Two-Class Problem. Each subplot shows the normalised class distribution of a feature. The title of each subplot includes the corresponding feature name, operation number, and classification accuracy. 3.3.2 Three-class classification Referring back to the mean velocity over time plot in Figure 3A , low-activity periods also occur during late-night (hour 20-22) but with higher average velocities than early-night sleep. It is therefore hypothesized that the two clusters seen for night-time sleep data may attribute to differences in early-night and late-night sleep. Therefore, the same dataset used in section 3.3.1 were re-labelled with \u2018light\u2019, \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 and \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019. The numbers of time series data for each class are 388, 477 and 126, respectively, indicating that sleep takes place predominately during the first part of the night. Three-class classification using linear SVM was performed on the 991 x 5202 feature matrix, yielding a mean balanced accuracy of 58.65%. A confusion matrix was created and visualised to determine how well the labels are distinguished from one another (Figure 9) . It is shown that \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 are well-discerned with true-positive rates over 70%, but \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019 is much more ambiguous. F9.

Top Features Each feature is individually assessed, and class distributions of the top 16 performing features are visualised in Figure 11A . Distributions of the two \u2018dark\u2019 classes are noticeably segregated, and \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 data points are mostly found in one cluster. This confirms the hypothesis that night-sleep patterns are different between early- and late-night. In addition, most of these features produced similar distributions, with \u2018dark (ZT_18-24)\u2019 having the highest mean and \u2018dark (ZT_12-18)\u2019 the lowest. To understand the similarities between top features, a pairwise correlation matrix was computed for the top 40 features (Figure 11B) . The matrix was clustered by the absolute correlation coefficient values, leading to only 3 clusters. Hence, these features are largely related to each other and measure similar properties of the time series. The most representative features based on classification performance and feature dependency are: [17] burstiness_Goh , [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_olapint , [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent , and [6112] PP_Compare_rav2_kscn_peaksepx .

Snippets of time series ordered by the output values are shown on the right. [17] burstiness_Goh and [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_olapint are both location- and spread dependent features that measure time series distribution, and their resulting plots are extremely similar (Figure 12A & 12B) . [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent is a measure of stationarity which slides a window along the time series, calculates the distribution entropy of each window and outputs an overall histogram entropy value (Figure 12C) . Therefore, it is also a measure of distribution and is highly correlated to [17] burstiness_Goh . On the other hand, [6112] PP_Compare_rav2_kscn_peaksepx is a combination of [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_ olapint and [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent , which applies a running average transformation (window length = 2) to the time series and quantifies differences between the kernel-smoothed and fitted distribution of the processed data (Figure 12D) . As a result, all four operations evaluates similar properties of the time series. Of which, [17] burstiness_Goh produces the highest classification accuracy and so is considered for further interpretation in the Discussion page. van Alphen B, Yap MHW, Kirszenblat L, Kottler B, van Swinderen B.

To intuitively look for potential characteristics of each variable, the mean and confidence interval of variable value averaged over 210 fly recordings were computed and plotted over time (Figure 3) . Figure 3A shows that mean velocity is highly cyclical, which is expected as the Drosophila activity level follows a circadian rhythm. Fly with a velocity value under 1 is considered to be immobile, and long periods of immobility (i.e., sleep) are typically observed during the mid-day (hour 2-9) and early-night (hour 14-18). Interestingly, the x and phi variables also display a similar pattern that has lower mean values at these sleep periods (Figure 3B & 3C) , although the corresponding degree of uncertainty is much higher. For w , h and area , a sudden change in value when switching to dark is seen (Figure 3D & 3E & 3F) . This could be the result of a technical defect as the camera becomes less capable of detecting fly boundaries in dim lighting. The overall area may be larger during night than day due to this problem.","title":"3.1.1 Patterns of each Variable"},{"location":"results/#f3-variables-over-time","text":"A) mean velocity B) x C) phi D) w E) h F) area Figure 3A.

To exploratively investigate whether our multivariate data reflects this hypothesis, time series were extracted from specific times during the mid-day and early-night for HCTSA analysis. Initially, 20-min periods were taken and subjected to feature extraction, but over 30% of HCTSA operations were not able to yield good-quality features as most operations were designed for analysing longer time series. Therefore, 60-min periods were taken from hour 6-7 (mid-day) and hour 13-14 (early-night), and they were labelled as \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018dark\u2019 accordingly. Since HCTSA only supports single-variable analysis, a HCTSA computation was done for each of the mean velocity , x , phi and area variables, producing four different feature matrices. Three different classifiers were used: linear support vector machine ( SVM ), decision tree, and K-nearest neighbours ( kNN ) (Table 1) . SVM consistently yielded the highest classification accuracy amongst the three. Of the four variables included, mean velocity and area time series are the most distinguishable between the two time periods. However, the high classification rates for area may be due to bias in image recognition, and so only the mean velocity is considered.","title":"3.1.2 Classifying Set Periods in Mid-day and Early-night"},{"location":"results/#t1-classifcation-rates","text":"Table 1.

It would therefore be useful to robustly define and extract sleep sessions from the data for a more stringent analysis. Initially, the five-minute rule 2 was applied to identify sleep, where periods of at least five continuous minutes of inactivity are labelled as asleep. However, using this metric alone to extract sleep sessions for time series analysis has two limitations: 1) successive inactive periods may be disrupted by short bursts of activities, resulting in fragmented sleep periods and hence fewer time series data of at least 60-min available for HCTSA feature extraction, 2) it could potentially filter out lighter sleep stages, and the remaining mean velocity time series would inherently all have little fluctuations, making it difficult to distinguish between them. To overcome these limitations, another metric for defining sleep sessions was developed. In addition to the five-minute rule, short bursts (\u2264 5min) of activities are allowed between inactive sleep periods and are still labelled as asleep. This allows longer periods of sleep to be extracted for HCTSA analysis and classification. Examples of the time series produced are shown in Figure 4 . It can be seen that bursts of activity occur periodically during both day-sleep and night-sleep, and nuances between the two are searched for using HCTSA analysis.","title":"3.2.1 Identifying Sleep Sessions"},{"location":"results/#f4-time-series-plot","text":"Figure 4.

B) Distributions of raw values obtained by comparing kernal-smoothed and fitted distribution of time series are plotted on the left. Snippets of time series ordered by the output values are shown on the right. Figure 12. Single Feature Analysis for the Three-Class Problem. C) Distributions of raw values obtained by applying a sliding window to time series are plotted on the left. Snippets of time series ordered by the output values are shown on the right. Figure 12. Single Feature Analysis for the Three-Class Problem. D) Distributions of raw values obtained by comparing rolling averaged time series are plotted on the left. Snippets of time series ordered by the output values are shown on the right. [17] burstiness_Goh and [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_olapint are both location- and spread dependent features that measure time series distribution, and their resulting plots are extremely similar (Figure 12A & 12B) . [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent is a measure of stationarity which slides a window along the time series, calculates the distribution entropy of each window and outputs an overall histogram entropy value (Figure 12C) . Therefore, it is also a measure of distribution and is highly correlated to [17] burstiness_Goh . On the other hand, [6112] PP_Compare_rav2_kscn_peaksepx is a combination of [3262] DN_CompareKSFit_rayleigh_ olapint and [632] SY_SlidingWindow_ent_ent , which applies a running average transformation (window length = 2) to the time series and quantifies differences between the kernel-smoothed and fitted distribution of the processed data (Figure 12D) . As a result, all four operations evaluates similar properties of the time series. Of which, [17] burstiness_Goh produces the highest classification accuracy and so is considered for further interpretation in the Discussion page. van Alphen B, Yap MHW, Kirszenblat L, Kottler B, van Swinderen B.

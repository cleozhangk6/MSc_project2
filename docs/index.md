Sleep in Drosophila has to date been assumed to be homogenous throughout, with no changes in the internal state between the early and late stages. This is at odds with our understanding of more complex animals, such as mammals and birds, whose sleep is known to dynamically partitioned into light and deep sleep or REM and NREM sleep. Novel studies in Drosophila measuring whole brain and individual neuronal activity have begun to dispel the simplistic sleep model in Drosophila with evidence of changing neuronal activity during sleep, in particular slow wave oscillatory brain activity reminiscent of deep sleep in mammals. Currently the rule for measuring sleep, five minutes of immobility, does not reflect a dynamic sleep model, but is an easy to apply tool suitable for high throughput screens. To this extent the founding of new, dynamic rules to measure sleep would expand Drosophila as the model for sleep whilst retaining its positive high throughput aspects. This study looks to find new rules through the application of a range of modelling and time analysis tools to the data generated by the Ethoscope, a high throughput system for measuring fruit fly sleep by machine vision. The Ethoscope generates several measurements that are currently unused that describe the location, the angle the fly faces, and the size of the fly. These variables have been explored to find correlations with arousal threshold and changes throughout periods of consolidated immobility. Currently no definitive findings have been documented, but they have built the foundation for further data exploration.

All data for this project is retreived from previous experiments done in the Gilestro Lab. Computationally intensive work in this project was performed on remote servers. Catch-22 analysis was performed locally. Highly comparative time-series analysis (HCTSA) was submitted as jobs to be run on the Imperial Research Computing Service with 4 CPUs and 64 GB memory. Data processing, exploratory analysis and visualisation tasks were carried out using Python or MATLAB on a 16 GB MacBook Pro.

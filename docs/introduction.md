## 1.1. Sleep Behaviours in *Drosophila Melanogaster*

Sleep is an important yet complex physiological process that occurs in virtually every animal that has been studied so far, but its underpinnings and functions remain elusive despite the rapidly developing effort towards sleep analysis. Mammalian sleep is known to be a multistage process with varying sleep depth associated with changes in neuronal activity [^1][^2][^3]. In humans, for example, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings can be used to identify the different sleep stages which circulate between wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM). It is believed that different sleep stages may serve distinct biological functions. For instance, evidence has shown that deep sleep contributes to bodily recovery and growth [^4], while REM sleep is essential to cognitive functions such as memory and learning [^5]. 

Over the last few decades, the fruit fly *Drosophila Melanogaster* has been an increasingly popular model organism to understand how sleep is controlled by internal and external stimuli and how it affects other biological functions. The simplicity, cost-effectiveness, rapid developmental time, and relevance to human genetics and physiology have made *Drosophila* an indispensable tool [^6]. In most current studies, the sleeping state in *Drosophila* is  defined by a simple metric: immobility for more than five minutes, and it is often assumed to be homogenous throughout. Nevertheless, there has been increasing evidence that sleep in *Drosophila* is also a dynamic process with differing sleep intensities [^7]. Methods including EEG recordings, arousal-testing, and Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER) protocols have been used to show that Drosophila exhibits a deep sleep stage which is characterised by 1) reduced neural activity, 2) increased arousal threshold, and 3) stereotypical postural movement, namely the extensions and retractions of the proboscis [^8][^9].
